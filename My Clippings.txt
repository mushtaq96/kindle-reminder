Interpretation + identification + repetition = strong emotion Interpretation: is when you interpret an event or a thought based on your personal story. Identification: is when you identify with a specific thought as it arises. Repetition: is having the same thoughts over and over. Strong emotion: is when you experience an emotion so many times it has become part of your identity. You then experience that emotion whenever a related thought or event triggers it.

For instance, if believed, the thought, “I’m not good enough,” will generate negative emotions such as shame or guilt. Conversely, when you feel ashamed for ‘not being good enough,’ you’ll attract more thoughts in line with that belief. You will focus on the things (you believe) you aren’t good at, or remember and dwell on past failures. This, in turn, will strengthen your erroneous belief.

Confident people deposit positive thoughts in their mind each day. They celebrate their small wins and treat themselves with compassion and respect. Naturally, they expect good things to happen. On the other hand, people with low self-esteem bombard their mind with disempowering thoughts. They discard their accomplishments as ‘no big deal’ and fail to recognize their strengths and the positive intent behind their actions. No wonder they feel unworthy.

Analyze your negative emotions Identify the story behind your emotions: Take a pen and paper, and write down all the reasons why you have these emotions in the first place. What assumptions do you hold? How did you interpret what’s happening to you? Now, see if you can let go of this particular story. Write down your emotions in a journal: Take a few minutes each day to write down how you felt. Look for recurrent patterns. Then, use affirmations, visualization, or a relevant exercise to help you overcome these emotions. Practice mindfulness: Observe your emotions throughout the day. Meditation will help you do this. Another way is simply to engage in an activity while being fully present. As you’re doing this, observe what’s going on in your mind.

Exercise 1 - Realizing people don’t care This exercise will help you understand at a deep level, most people are not really concerned about you. Choose one person you know. It might be a friend, an acquaintance, or a colleague. Ask yourself how often you think about that person in your daily life. Now, put yourself in the shoes of that person. How much do you imagine he or she thinks about you during an average day? How much does he or she keep track of what you do or say? What do you think he or she is worrying about right now? Repeat this process with at least two more people. As you do this exercise, you’ll probably realize other people are simply too busy to think of you often. After all, they live with themselves 24/7.

I used to resent my mother for being overly protective. I blamed her for not encouraging me to grow, but instead, her actions made me weaker than I already was. Perhaps, it was one of the reasons I embarked on a personal development journey. However, I realized she didn’t have any bad intentions. She simply meant well and did the best she could.

resentment is the result of your attachment to the past. Forgiveness is simply reconnecting with the only thing that is real, the present, while forgetting about what isn’t real, the past. Then, release it. Imagine how your life would be and how you would feel once you’ve let go of the resentment. Do it right now. Then, let go. Forgive.

Also, guard against looking only at areas in which your friends seem to have it better than you. Perhaps, you focus on the fact they’re making more money than you, or have a partner while you are single. Or perhaps you envy them for some of their natural strengths and abilities. The problem here is you fail to make an ‘apple to apple’ comparison. You dismiss your own strengths or qualities which make you feel as though you’re not as good as they are.

When you sell a stock, reinvest your principal amount in another good quality stock. 2. If you sell a stock with 15% profits within three months of buying and reinvest your 15% profit plus rotate your money every three months with 15% profit, then your annualised profit for one year is 74%. Also, consider 10% additional as dividend income, so your net annualised return with dividend is 84%. 3. If you initially invest $100 and add $10 per month and your money is growing 84% annually, then after 20 years, you have nearly $7,18,03,722. 4. When your trade gives you 15% of profits, then hold it with a trailing stop-loss, 15% is the minimum range of profits, but it does not mean that you sell your stocks at a trigger price of 15%. After 15% gain, watch your stock closely.

we say the base price, means three years’ DMA of stock. In the calculation of the base price do not forget to adjust for bonus and stock split. For example, if a Rs. 10 face value stock market price is Rs. 100 and the stock splits in Rs. 2 face value, then you would count before the split price as Rs. 20 instead of Rs. 100. Remember for the base price or 3 years’ DMA calculation, your stock must be listed for three years because if you calculate the base price below three years’ price, then the calculation does not work properly.

If a stock has crossed its base price in upside and traded 10-20% higher than the base price, then I think the buying price is a good value, but on the other hand, if the stock crosses its base price from upperside to downside, then that stock is risky to buy. If you buy a stock below the base price, then it is cheap but your waiting period may be 1-2 years for a decent return and if your stock market price is more than 20% of the base price, then the valuation of the stock is already high. My simple formula for investment horizons is to buy below 20% of the base price and sell above 20% of the base price. But for trading purposes, buy 5% above the base price in an uptrend (uptrend means the stock crosses its base price from lower price to upper price) and sell 15% above the base price.

‘If a stock just crosses its base price in upside and traded 10-20% higher from the base price, then I think buying price is a value buy but in the opposite case, if the stock crosses its base price in downside, then it is risky to buy’. It means if the stock price is up from its lower price to higher price and traded 10% above base price but still doesn’t cross 20% upside from base price, then it is a value buy. If it crosses more than 20% upside from the base price, then I would not buy it because I think the valuation of this stock is already higher from the base price.

So if you use the net sales per share ratio, then it is quite an interesting thing, and you may be picking a good loss-making company at a lower valuation with the possibility of turning around. For analysis of this method, take the last quarter of the net sale figure (net income or net revenue) of your company and divide it by the total number of shares, this ratio is called net sale per share for a quarter.

For calculating the fundamental target, first of all, check yearly net revenue per stock and note it down in a diary. Suppose company A had a net revenue of Rs. 1000 crore last year, and the total number of stocks in company A is ten crore, then net revenue per stock per year is 1000/10 = 100, so note down 100. (In Lesson 4 of this book, I have described to you the net revenue per share concept ‘When last quarter’s net sales data (net income or net revenue) of your company is divided by the total number of shares, this ratio is called net sale per share for a quarter. Multiply this by four, then this is our estimated “Net sale per year”’.

Try to understand speculation of pricing in stock markets. 2. Avoid a stock which has a recent bulk (block) deal. 3. In my criteria of the stock screening, I always avoid a stock which has had a bulk deal in the last two years. (For trading stocks, I reduced this time frame from last two years to last one year). 4. When bulk deals happen in any stock which traded near its year-high and all-time high, then a downturn in this stock may be starting in the coming 1-2 months.

before you try to buy this type of stocks (stocks traded below face value), you must consider seven points of checking: 1. Promoter’s holding is more than 15%. 2. Book value is not more than three times of stock current market price. Please also avoid stock with negative book value. 3. The 52-week high/low ratio is less than two.

Stock below face value is risky, so always check other fundamental points like base price, one-year net revenue per share, recent bulk deals, recent stock split and bonus before you buy.

I see a year high and year-low for each stock and if the stock is down more than 50% from a year-high, then I avoid this stock. For example, year-high of stock A is 256.55, year’s low is 96 and the stock traded at 108.55, then I avoid this stock because good companies never go down more than 50% within a year unless something is wrong.

stock is trading more than 100% from year-low, then I avoid it for example company B is traded at 56 and year-high for this company is 65.25, & year-low is 19.55, then I avoid it because I think this stock is already running very fast and it is better to wait for the market fall.

Promoter’s Holding: If the promoter is holding 15-20%, then I think the stock is not good for investing; if the promoter holding is reduced in the last one to four quarters, then I think something is wrong and avoid this type of stock because promoters are selling their stocks to retail investors, but if promoters increase their holding, then I think it is good because promoters know this company’s fundamentals very well.

When you compare prices of the two stocks, always look at their face value for identifying which stock is cheaper. 2. Do not buy if a stock falls more than 50% from the year-high. 3. Do not buy if a stock rises more than 100% from year-low. 4. Always avoid a stock which promoters are holding below 15%, and where promoters have reduced their holdings in the last one year. 5. Avoid a stock which traded 20% above its base price. 6. Choose a stock which traded below its one-year net revenue per share. 7. Avoid a stock which has a recent bulk deal in the last two years. 8.

After a bonus issue and split in the face value, the number of stocks rises, so company’s net EPS is diluted after the bonus. 2. Bonus and the stock split are not a big change for buying a stock. 3. After a bonus and split, investors may sell their extra stocks, so stock shows a downside after a bonus and face value split.

The bonus does not change company fundamentals and only creates a psychological effect for investors. I will clarify this, suppose one company has a total of 100 shares, and the company earns 1000 rupees in a year. Then EPS of the company is 1000/100 = 10, okay. Now the company declares bonus 1:4, that means if you hold four shares, the company gives four shares to you free. So the total number of shares after the bonus issue has increased from 100 to 500 but the profit of the company is still 1000; so after bonus, EPS of the company is 1000/500 = 2 means that EPS is diluted after the bonus, and you see a price adjustment after bonus. So, the bonus is beneficial only when the profit of the company increases, otherwise it will dilute the EPS and give a negative effect on long-term share price but in the short-term, if the company declares bonus, the demand of the general public increases because they do not understand that this is an equity dilution and for any increase in equity they think company is just giving them free shares.

On 31 December 2007, when the Indian market traded at its all-time high, I bought an infra stock named Punj Lloyd which traded at 560 Indian rupees. I bought ten stocks and invested 5600 rupees in Punj Lloyd stock. After that, the markets crashed badly and when the stock crashed more than 50% from its year-high within a year (in earlier articles of this book, I have already told you to avoid a stock which is crashing more than 50% within a year), I sold these 10 stocks of Punj Lloyd @256 and got Rs. 2560.

Do not buy a stock which traded below this 200 DMA. If stock traded above 200 DMA, then hold it. When a stock closes below 5% of 200 DMA, then it is a sign of selling your stock either for profit or the loss. Because in more than 90% cases, I find if stock closes 5% or more below 200 DMA, then it enters a long-term downtrend so if you sell your stock on this break even point, then you may protect your investments from further downside. When correction is over, and your stock closes at 5% above 200 DMA, then buy the same quantity again.

“Sometimes these things are too much” can help them understand that you get it. If that doesn’t help, you might try smiling and saying, “You look like how I feel.” When they say, “How’s that?” or, “What does that mean?” you can say, “I just don’t like these things. I know everybody else does, and I should, but I just don’t like ’em.”

Shy people are often thought to be introverts, but there’s a big difference between the two. The shy person doesn’t like being alone. They want to connect, interact, and be with people, but are afraid to. The introvert, on the other hand, likes spending time alone and will feel drained after spending time with people.

SMILE. The easiest and most potent nonverbal cue you can exhibit is a smile. Nothing too big or unnatural for the situation, but a smile you’ve practiced in the bathroom mirror. One that’s small, pleasant, and relaxed. 2. LEGS AKIMBO. Don’t go overboard with this one. When standing, make sure your legs are about shoulder-width apart. Don’t sway back and forth if you’re a swayer. 3. SHOULDERS PULLED BACK. When you look like you’re not worried or guarded, you’re much more approachable. This cue will make you feel confident as well.

You want their brain to fire off oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine. Those are the bonding chemicals known as the “Happy Hormones.”

when someone’s arms are crossed or when one’s shoulder shrugs, it means nothing specific. When someone tells you it DOES mean something specific, just smile, act normal, and nod your head (with your eyebrows up of course, because supposedly you’re taking in new information). When you see someone in panic mode using every adaptor and barrier they have at their disposal, say nothing. Just observe. You’re about to learn so much more about that person.

Savings can be created by spending less.
You can spend less if you desire less.
And you will desire less if you care less about what others think of you.
As I argue often in this book, money relies more on psychology than finance.
  And you don’t need a specific reason to save.

The solution is simple: Use room for error when estimating your future returns. This is more art than science. For my own investments, which I’ll describe more in chapter 20, I assume the future returns I’ll earn in my lifetime will be ⅓ lower than the historic average. So I save more than I would if I assumed the future will resemble the past. It’s my margin of safety. The future may be worse than ⅓ lower than the past, but no margin of safety offers a 100% guarantee. A one-third buffer is enough to allow me to sleep well at night. And if the future does resemble the past, I’ll be pleasantly surprised. “The best way to achieve felicity is to aim low,” says Charlie Munger. Wonderful.

The independent feeling I get from owning our house outright far exceeds the known financial gain I’d get from leveraging our assets with a cheap mortgage. Eliminating the monthly payment feels better than maximizing the longterm value of our assets. It makes me feel independent. I don’t try to defend this decision to those pointing out its flaws, or those who would never do the same. On paper it’s defenseless. But it works for us. We like it. That’s what matters. Good decisions aren’t always rational. At some point you have to choose between being happy or being “right.”

Values act as our compass to put us back on course every single day, so that day after day, we’re moving in the direction that takes us closer and closer to our definition of the “best” life we could possibly live. The “best” is your own ideal, but generally as you get closer to this ideal, you’ll enjoy increasingly positive shades of “better” even if you never reach “best.” And this makes sense because many results in life exist on a continuum.

For example, if you’ve been breaking your back to get a particular job and you exaggerate its importance, you’ll push it away. If you shower your new date with compliments and praise, he or she will become skeptical and wonder about your intentions. Too much of anything, even if it comes with positive intentions, will disrupt balance.

Overindulging in the negative creates a temporary sense of relief and commonality between people. However, it also leads to the fulfillment of the negative condition. This throws you further out of balance and soon, you’re in a personal hell.

when we delay a decision, we move out of balance and cause ourselves more stress than we need to. Instead of thinking about a decision, we overthink it, slipping into what’s known as dualistic thinking, implying “either/or” not “both.” We think there is a “right” and a “wrong;” a “good” and a “bad;” a “better” and a “worse.”

By focusing inwardly, you prevent yourself from playing the game society has imposed on you. It’s a game in which your desires aren’t yours—they’re repackaged versions of everyone else’s desires. As a result, everyone has similar desires—they think the same thoughts, make the same choices—and live the life of the ninety-nine percent.

For many of you reading this right now, you’re likely in the rising action or climax of your movie. Create a 5-part timeline of your life as if it were one big movie. Outline five specific years that will be part of your story. The first year will be your exposition. The second, your rising action, and so on. The falling action and resolution can be a description of you achieving your short or long-term vision. Give a brief and to-the-point summary for each section. Once you’ve outlined your story, there is absolutely no reason to get stuck in the past or future anymore. Your story has been defined and it will stay that way. Once the story finishes (or you accomplish the goal), feel free to create a part two.

Our body has two major nerve centers: the brain and the heart. Often, as we navigate the trials and triumphs of our lives, we rely on logic and rationality to guide us rather than listening to our intuition and hearts.

In a world with more information than we know what to do with, it’s crucial to audit the information we consume. We can lose ourselves in the clutter and junk on the internet. We must be wary of the people we follow and the content we watch on social media. Although the internet revolutionized the way we connect with one another, if we unconsciously consume information on the net, it can warp our perception of reality. When everyone’s lives are on display 24-7, it’s easy for the ego to get into the game of comparison, and this can lead to suffering and low self-esteem.

a sisu mindset calls for recognizing your circumstances, evaluating your options, and taking determined action toward achieving your desired outcome. It’s an acceptance that things are not working in your favor, but a commitment to press forward in spite of that fact.

Studies show we’re more likely to succeed if we habitually practice self-control. If we delay gratification by way of habit, we stand a much better chance of experiencing success.

Let’s clarify what it means to delay gratification. It’s the decision to resist enjoying something we crave in the present for something we crave even more down the road. For example, suppose you’re trying to lose five pounds. You walk past a pizza parlor and are tempted to purchase a slice. You love pizza and can practically taste it. You now have a decision to make. You can sate your present craving. Or you can resist the temptation and decide to steer clear of the pizza in order to meet your goal (losing five pounds). Notice that it’s a decision. You’re in control. This means exerting self-restraint is a skill you can learn and hone. As you’ll see below, controlling your impulses is paramount to developing mental toughness.

Delaying gratification also improves our ability to ignore distractions. Think of a recent time when you needed to work on something important. For example, you might have needed to complete a report for your job. Or perhaps you needed to complete a long list of household chores. Whatever the case, there were undoubtedly other activities you would rather have been doing. The temptation to indulge in them was a distraction. It threatened to dash your focus. By regularly practicing self-control, you develop the ability to withstand such temptations and remain resolute in your intentions. This is a crucial skill to possess when you encounter unexpected obstacles in the present.

we might habitually choose to eat unhealthy fast food because it’s easy, convenient, and tasty. Low effort, high reward. Unfortunately, this habit can severely hamper our intention to lose weight, improve cardiovascular health, and build muscle mass.

When we repeatedly delay gratification, we form a connection in our minds between self-restraint, effort, and reward. We begin to intuitively recognize that we must exert effort, and in the process control our impulses, to attain what we want.

Tip #1: Clarify your values. When you recognize what truly matters to you, it becomes easier to prioritize things you’d like to accomplish. That simplifies the decision-making process. It also juxtaposes the importance of your long-term goals with the fleeting pleasure of your short-term desires.

It also juxtaposes the importance of your long-term goals with the fleeting pleasure of your short-term desires. Tip #2: Understand why you’d like to achieve your goal(s). It’s important to have a compelling reason prompting you to take action. Brainstorm that reason for each of your goals. For example, suppose you wish to lose 10 pounds. Your reason may be to feel and look healthier. These motives will encourage you to resist the temptation to eat

Tip #4: Find a productive alternative to a compulsive desire. Some temptations are more difficult to resist than others. Simple willpower isn’t enough. In such cases, brainstorm another reward to take its place, preferably one with productive value. For example, you might find pizza irresistible. Junk food is addictive because it triggers the release of dopamine, stimulating the brain’s reward center. A productive alternative is physical activity. It too releases dopamine along with endorphins. It may be less fun

EXERCISE #5 Describe (in writing) a recent incident during which you gave in to a temptation, and in doing so procrastinated or abandoned something you needed to complete. Then describe how your decision made you feel after you had satisfied the craving. Did you feel guilty? Did you experience regret? Did you chastise yourself for surrendering to the temptation? Next, describe a recent incident during which you resisted a temptation and persisted to complete an important task. Then describe how that decision made you feel. Did you feel pleased with your resolve? Did you feel empowered? The purpose of this exercise is to highlight how delaying gratification for the purpose of achieving longer-term goals instinctively feels good to us. It reinforces the idea that controlling our impulses can yield outcomes upon which we place greater value. Time required: 15 minutes.

The next step is to make slow, incremental progress. There’s no need to grow your new habit by leaps and bounds. This isn’t a race. In fact, striving to progress quickly is likely to do more harm than good. For many people, doing so is a recipe for failure. Take small steps forward. Returning to our previous example, don’t try to advance from the initial 5-minute time chunk to working in 45-minute time chunks. Instead, take a small break (perhaps 60 seconds) after the first 5-minute time chunk. Then do another. And another. After you’ve done that successfully a few times, break up your work into 10-minute time chunks. Take 2-minute breaks between them.

For example, suppose you’re training yourself to continue working after taking short breaks. The problem is, you’d rather abandon your work and watch your favorite show on Netflix. Try this: pick a short, inspiring song. End each break by listening to it. Immediately after the song finishes playing, begin a new work session. This will cause your brain to create an association between the song and your next action (in this case, getting back to work). The next time you hear the song, you’ll feel compelled to get back to work.

Third, you might commit to saying no to others, focusing instead on your own projects and responsibilities. Time required: 15 minutes.

Willingness to leave your comfort zone. By leaving our comfort zone, we expose ourselves to unfamiliar situations. Doing so reveals that such situations rarely warrant fear. On the contrary, they offer opportunities to grow, both personally and professionally. They give us a chance to surrender our need to control our circumstances and learn to adapt to new ones.

Abandon your desire for external validation. Seeking approval from others hurts your self-confidence. It trains your mind to distrust your motivations and abilities. Instead, your mind learns to refrain from taking action until it receives permission to do so from someone else. Over time, you become wary and begin to harbor misgivings about your ability to perform. Recognize that you possess unique value. Your knowledge, skills, talents, and adaptability eliminate the need for external validation. As long as your confidence levels are aligned with reality, you can be self-assured and self-assertive when you face uncertainty.

This might include negative self-talk, a messy workspace, sloppy physical appearance, or an absence of personal boundaries. Everyone is different, and therefore your list will be unique to you. Next, write down actions you can take to reduce the effect of each item on your self-confidence. Be specific. For example, if you struggle with negative self-talk, you might commit to confronting your inner critic whenever it speaks.

Resist the urge to complain to others. Complaining merely reinforces the unhealthy tendency to seek validation. Reflect on the good things in your life. Tell a friend or family member that you love and appreciate them. You’ll make that person’s day and you’ll feel good, too. It’s a win-win!

If you give a presentation at work and don’t receive enthusiastic accolades from every attendee, you’ve failed.

The judges were more likely to grant parole during the brief period that immediately followed their lunch break. One explanation for this phenomenon is decision fatigue, a form of mental fatigue. The more decisions we make, the less willpower (i.e. fuel in our tank) we have to make subsequent decisions. The absence of willpower makes it difficult for us to make hard choices, and we instead choose the easier option.

The key to taking action in the absence of willpower and motivation is to rely on habits. Create routines and rituals that spur you to take action on autopilot. Once these routines are in place, you’ll no longer be a powerless victim to decision fatigue. You’ll no longer need to wait to feel motivated to pursue a change in your circumstances.

You must affirm the ideas of this individual's world to build trust between the two of you. If you think their thoughts are correct or skewed, it doesn't matter. Initially, you have to make them see you as someone who blends into their little mental world before you do anything else.

One way to detect a manipulator is to see if a person acts with different faces in front of other people and in different situations. While all of us have a degree of this type of social differentiation, some psychological manipulators tend to habitually dwell in extremes, being highly polite to one individual and completely rude to another—or totally helpless one moment and fiercely aggressive the next.

If you’re in a situation with a true manipulator, your two goals for any confrontation that occurs should be to diffuse and exit, whether that means exiting the current conversation or exiting the friendship. Avoid insults, arguments, losing your temper, accusing the other person of manipulation, or getting overly emotional. When you speak, stick to statements that are truthful, objective, and peaceful.

The biggest mistake you can make when dealing with a dishonest person is trying to correct them. You fall deeper into their pit by correcting them. Manipulative individuals can use frustration and uncertainty to bait you into a confrontation. In order to see how you tick, they want to make you emotional. They'll use them to manipulate your decisions until they know the things that cause you. A smarter approach is to totally disregard them. Just delete them from your life. If you can't immediately erase them, like if they're a boss, coworker, or family member, agree with what they're doing and then go do your own thing anyway.

Avoid letting people who are manipulative use their tactics against you. Turn the tables instead. Build your own plan and hit them where it hurts. If you are forced to deal with a manipulative person who tries to make your life hell, no matter how hard you try to ignore them, you have only one choice, finding and attacking their center of gravity. This center may be the associates, followers, or subordinates of the deceptive person. It may be a high-level talent or a sophisticated knowledge of a specific area. It may be a specific resource they control. Either way, figure out what their center of gravity is and make it yours. Build allies with individuals close to them, recruit individuals to replace them with their skillsets and knowledge base, or siphon away their valuable resources. This will throw them off balance

Chip Heath,1 co-author of Made to Stick, conducted an experiment at Stanford University to demonstrate the impact of storytelling on memory and persuasion. He asked some of his students to deliver to their classmates a 1-minute speech on the issue of non-violent crime in the US. He then asked the listeners to rate the speakers based on their delivery and persuasiveness. After the exercise, Heath distracted the listeners for a few minutes with a random video, then abruptly asked them to write down every single idea from each speaker they had listened to. When asked to remember the ideas, the listeners were shocked to find out how little they remembered about the speeches they’d listened to only a few minutes before. Only 5% of them recalled any numbers or statistics. And that was in a class full of some of the smartest people on the planet.

toy horse, a wooden mallet, a meat thermometer, a jar of marbles, and a Santa Claus nutcracker. Insignificant objects. Junk. Objects that all of us have in the deepest corners of our houses. Then, they invited a group of volunteers to write short stories about each item. They listed the items for sale on eBay, but instead of including a plain, simple description of the product, they added the fictional stories. The 100 items were originally purchased for $129 in total. How much do you think they sold for? They sold for $3,613. That’s roughly a 2,700% increase in value, all from including a short fictional story. This experiment illustrates that stories can increase the perceived value of any product or service.

Storytelling builds trust In a series of experiments,3 neuroeconomics pioneer Paul Zak explored the impact of stories on the brain. In an experiment, Zak and his team asked volunteers to watch one of two versions of a video about a dying boy. The first version had a clear narrative arc (aka a story), while the second had a “flat” narrative arc (i.e. no story). The team took blood samples from the volunteers before and after viewing the videos. What do you think they found? They found that those who watched the video with the story experienced an increase in oxytocin. Oxytocin is also known as the love hormone. When the brain synthesizes oxytocin, people become more trustworthy, generous, charitable, and compassionate. When you tell a well-crafted story, your listener’s brain releases oxytocin, making them more likely to trust you and your ideas.

Step 1: Context In the first step, you want to give your listeners some rough context for the story. Describe when and where the events took place, who the main character was, and what they were up to. The when, where, and who Most of your stories can start with one sentence that clarifies when, where, and who.

Why does it matter to state the time, location, and main character? Because these three points give your story instant credibility. People will immediately believe that it’s a true story. If you leave any of these points out, your listeners may spend more time questioning your story than listening to it.

For example: “I was a little surprised to have him on the phone, but then I thought ‘This is great. I can now share the newest innovation from our R&D department. He’ll be super impressed.’” “I was tired of life. It had been a very hectic year and I was ready for a break.” “He felt good about the week. If he kept that performance up, he’d be promoted to partner in no time.” By sharing what’s on the character’s mind, your listeners will start caring. They’ll become invested and want to know what is going to happen to the person next. Two or three specific sentences are usually enough to achieve this.

How can you get people to hang on to every word you say? … By bringing in elements of surprise. Surprise refers to moments in the story that are unexpected. This can be anything that breaks the typical patterns of what your listeners expect.

say before your story to get your listeners excited about the story. For example: “A couple of months ago, one of our customers found a very creative solution for exactly your problem…”  “I learned a major lesson just a few months back…” “Working with that agency was mind-blowing…” Note: I recommend using anticipation hooks sparingly. If you use them too often, you’ll undermine your credibility because every story is framed as the “craziest” or “most interesting” experience.

Everyone will think I’m a failure…” By sharing what the character thinks, you make your listeners care. The more they know about the character, the more they’ll be rooting for them.

As presentation skills expert Patricia Fripp explains, “Stories need to be true, not 100% accurate.” Feel free to exaggerate the thoughts to make it more dramatic. Imagine you told a story about a mistake you made. Some genuine inner dialogue could have included, “Oh shoot; this is bad!” If you wanted to take it up a notch and make it more emotional, you could say, “Oh shoot. That sucks! No doubt he’ll call my boss and complain about getting the worst service in his life. Goodbye bonus. Goodbye promotion.” A good rule of thumb when bending the truth is to ask yourself: if someone was with you when the actual event happened, would they recognize the story as truthful? If they’d look at you with a “WTF are you talking about?” expression, this would indicate that you’ve gone too far.

An ideal place to use outer dialogue is during the challenge (e.g., “My boss came up to me and said, ‘Mario, what the hell? Your presentation was full of typos!’”) or the result (e.g., “My client yelled down the phone, ‘We did it. We’ve just been featured in Time magazine. I can’t believe this is happening!’”) What if you can’t remember the exact words that were used in specific situations? Similar to what we discussed with inner dialogue, you have some creative freedom here. Think what could have been said in the moment. What are the words that you, your boss, or your client could have used in this crucial moment? Try to use words that are sharp and trigger an emotional response.

Focus on asking great questions: After your story, ask them, “How about you? Have you ever been in [situation of your story]?” For the question to work, it’s important to pick a question they can likely respond to with a story themselves. If you pick a question that is too niche, you won’t get a story in return. For example, a less effective question would be “What about you? Have you driven a Ford Mustang?” Chances are that your buyer hasn’t driven a Ford Mustang, and even if they have, they won’t have a story about it. A better question would be “What about you? What has been your most amazing driving experience?”

We’re social animals.

Don’t try to “wing it” Some people prefer not to rehearse their story so it appears more natural when they tell it. While I like the idea behind this, I wouldn’t recommend it. By not rehearsing at all, there’s a strong chance that you’ll talk too much about information that doesn’t matter or miss crucial moments of the story. By winging it, you’re setting yourself up for average results. Like in any other discipline, if you want outstanding results, you have to put in the reps.

Let’s start rewriting the stories you tell yourself by going through the following steps: Identify the self-limiting belief: Pick a few beliefs that have negatively impacted your confidence or ability to tell stories.  Challenge the belief: Pick one belief and ask yourself: “Is this belief really grounded?” and “What are the supporting facts?” Consider the consequences: Ask yourself: “What will my life be like in the future if 1) I continue with that belief or 2) I let go of that belief?” Replace the belief: Replace the belief with a new, more constructive belief.  Put the new belief into practice: Commit to one small action today to test the new belief.

by analyzing the data of roughly 25k B2B sales conversations using AI. They found that the top sales reps listen 23% more than the bottom sales reps. The top reps talked on average 43% and listened 57%, while the bottom reps talked 66% and listened 34%. Fascinating, right? There’s a correlation between how successful you are in sales and your ability to listen. Listening helps you build trust, improve problem solving, and defuse any objections. But why does it matter for the stories you tell? Because before telling any story, you need to have a great understanding of what’s going on in your client’s business, what they’re struggling with, and what they’d like to accomplish in the future. You want to uncover what truly matters to your buyer.

“I’m gonna listen as if I were freaking Oprah Winfrey,” “I’m gonna listen to her as if she is the most interesting person on earth,” or “I’m gonna find out what truly matters to that person.” Just by saying this to myself once or twice, I’m more likely to make it my reality.

Here are my favorite questions: “Can you tell me more about that?” “Can you explain that? I want to make sure I understand you correctly.” “Why do you think that is the case?”

You want your listener to feel, ‘wow, they really get me.’ You can do this by paraphrasing what you’ve just heard. Here are some phrases you can use: “What I hear from you is… Is that right?” “Sounds like you are saying… Did I get that right?”  “If I’m hearing you correctly…“ “That must have been very… for you.” Note that we’re not only paraphrasing but also acknowledging their emotion and asking them to confirm (e.g., “Is that right?” and “Is that correct?”). This shows that you empathize with their situation and allows you to confirm whether you got it right.

In an upcoming conversation, try listening to understand. This can be at work or outside of work. Go ahead and try to apply a few of the techniques we’ve just covered: Ground yourself. Set an intention. Hold the silence. Ask clarifying questions. Paraphrase what you’ve heard. Don’t worry if you don’t apply all five techniques straight away. This usually takes quite some practice. Even if you apply just one of the techniques, you’re a much better listener already.

Most people would believe that our conscious mind contains all the information we have in our brain when the fact is that it composes less than 10% of our thoughts (Kluger, 2015). The overwhelming majority of our thoughts and behaviors are influenced by neural connections that happen behind the scenes, and most people are completely oblivious to this fact. Becoming aware of your unconscious thoughts and behaviors is definitely a good first step in the right direction.

This has a tremendous effect on our perspective, beliefs, vibration, and as a result, the reality we experience. There are three specific roadblocks that stop you from harnessing the true power of manifestation. These are: Negative emotions  Scarcity mindset  Old patterns

As humans, we were naturally born with a high vibrational frequency. Our purest form is seen in our younger years. When we were kids, we felt no shame or guilt for who we were because we hadn’t yet built a false identity to fit into the expectations of society. We used to dream big and never had any limitations for what was possible. This is when we were unconditioned by external reality. In other words, before we were conditioned by our parents, teachers, friends, media and other external entities, we were unlimited in our thinking – unhindered by thoughts and beliefs of limitation. As we grew up, this way of being changed.

you have the power to choose a new reality that no longer resonates with the old ones you've experienced. Your identity is flexible for change and not permanent to one way of being.

The goal is to become aware of these negative emotions, thoughts, and patterns, then shift the perspective around

steps to reaching optimal Feng Shui for manifesting money: Step 1: Clear out or cover up all of your broken items. Step 2: Keep things organized and in their place. Scattered items equal scattered energy. Step 3: Open up and clear the space. Move big items toward the walls or get rid of them. Give space to allow the energy to flow. Step 4: Invite nature to take part. Open up to natural sunlight and keep a plant or two around. Step 5: Implement the Money Jar Method. This process requires you to get however many jars you’d like (ideally 3-5) for all the places you frequent the most

Step 1: Accept the current circumstances that may have caused these negative emotions to arise. Acknowledge that these negative emotions are present and be aware of how they make you feel. Step 2: Take these negative emotions as a sign that your beliefs are out of alignment with what you want to attract. If you’re feeling worried or jealous, it’s because you’re operating from a state of lack. View these feelings as an important wakeup call that helps you come to the realization that you need to shift your focus. Step 3: Generalize the negative emotion and slowly begin to move up the emotional scale one step at a time. For example: Move from worried ☐ overwhelmed ☐ bored ☐ content ☐ hopeful ☐ enthusiastic ☐ joyful.

What we truly want is not the money, but the freedom that it gives us. In order to tap into the vibration of abundance, we need to start tuning into freedom. Start being aware of the freedom that you currently have in your life, even if it’s the smallest of things. Practice consciously tuning into this vibration and it will carry over to your finances. For example, you have the freedom to go take a walk outside, to eat the food that you eat, to have the things that you have, and to do the things that you do. Tap into the vibration of freedom and you will start noticing more freedom in the form of money coming your way.

You can only choose to act, think, and feel different right now. If you keep waiting for things to change, you’re not creating. If you’re not creating, then things aren’t changing. When you allow yourself to fully embrace your limitless potential to create your own reality, this is when the magic starts to happen.

Most people have a backwards idea of value despite the physical evidence that is right in front of their eyes. They believe that they can give value only when they receive something first. It simply doesn’t work that way. Holding onto this belief implies that the universe is scarce and that it isn’t infinitely abundant. When you’re dealing with abundance, you’re firmly stating that the more you give the more you get. There is no limit to how much you can give or receive as a result.

The key here is to do it from a place of sincerity and not from a place of “if I do this then I’ll get that.” It won’t work if you do the latter. Every action you take has a vibration behind it, and when your vibration is out of alignment with the action you’re taking, no matter how many times you perform that action, it’ll never serve you in a positive way.

We look at a person’s results and think that copying whatever they do must be the right way of doing things. The right way to evaluate a situation is to look at the energy inherent in it. A person who exhausts and punishes themselves in the name of their purpose doesn’t contribute to the energy of the world, they end up sucking more out of it. They place a burden on the ones they love and on those who work for them. Instead of spreading their vision as a gift, they end up spreading misery.

The Purpose Finding technique involves three simple steps. They are the following: Step 1: Set the intention of finding your passion. Put energy behind this endeavor. Most people never find their passions because they never go out to look for it. Become more aware of the things that draw you in and how you can provide value in this field. Step 2: Do things you enjoy doing. The definition of passion is: “An intense desire or enthusiasm for something.”

For example, if you believe that money is evil, there is a memory within you that pertains to this belief. Perhaps your parents told you this, or you suffered through some experience in your life that validates this thought. Visualization is a method of using this memory referencing for your benefit and helps you create new beliefs and paradigms.

If you’re unsure of how to distinguish between the voice of your compulsions and your intuition, consider the element of time within them. If the voice is time-traveling far into the future or is telling you stories from the past, then this is most certainly a compulsion. Intuition does not concern itself beyond the present moment.

leaves a mark in your subconscious mind. You start believing that no matter where you spend your money, it’s always going to be a waste. You avoid taking the risks you need to take to move forward, and this keeps you stuck. Saving your money just for the sake of saving it is not a good investment because money is energy. If you’re not planning on investing it in the future, it needs to go into something today. It needs to move and circulate in order to grow and help you generate more money. When you invest money and it doesn’t work out, it wasn’t because you invested the money, it was because you invested the money poorly.

It’s important to note that there is a difference between being patient and being complacent. Being patient means that you’re working to better yourself internally, because the better you feel with yourself despite the situation, the more your reality will reflect this. If you’re complacent, you’re not really changing your reality. What you’re doing is waiting for reality to change for you. This is yet another superficial perspective that contradicts the science of manifestation. If you’re waiting for reality to change, you’re not in the process of creation, and if you’re not in the process of creation, your reality is not changing.

Take actions, think thoughts, and feel feelings that are in alignment with this version of you. Step 2: Eliminate all feelings of doubt, disbelief, and disempowerment. You need to be receptive to everything that the universe has to offer and accept that it is possible for you to get that which you desire, no matter how big it is.

Money is simply energy. If you’re experiencing a lack of it, it’s due to certain blocks you’re carrying. Removing these blocks is as easy as moving into abundance and drawing the immense knowledge that the field has. Your life’s purpose, your perspectives, your vision, your goals, your beliefs… All of these play an important role in helping you align with the universe. Once everything is in alignment, like a well-oiled machine, the right energy and money will begin flowing to you. You might have been misled into thinking that one needs to do “hard” work for their money, that money only comes to those with unique talents, and so on. This is true only for those people who believe in such things.

Rather than feeling incompetent due to our lack of success this time, we’ll be inclined to incorporate the feedback and try again. So much depends on how we interpret failure. How we do so will influence our emotions, thoughts, and ultimately our responses. Our perception of failure - and by extension, the lessons we learn from it - can make the difference between giving up and persevering when life becomes difficult.

Fear is unnecessary and unproductive. Fear prevents us from taking action. And failure is the thing many of us intuitively fear the most. We shudder at the possibility that we’ll do something that’ll have a negative outcome. We worry that we’ll make fools of ourselves. This is the reason it’s so difficult to venture outside our comfort zones.

Navy SEALs must master a wide variety of disciplines. The problem is, most of their time isn’t spent in the field where they can put these skills to use. SEALs experience a lot of downtime. If they neglect to constantly practice their skills, they’ll get rusty. So they train over and over, guaranteeing they’ll be ready to perform when they’re on deployment. Application: Keep practicing skills that are essential to your long-term success, even if you feel you’ve mastered them.

For example, suppose you’ve been tasked with giving a presentation at your workplace. Segment the project.

You can further segment writing the content into creating your introduction, the body of your presentation, and your conclusion.

They mentally rehearse their activities and visualize their success. This technique is effective because, according to psychologists, the brain doesn’t differentiate between actual experiences and imagined experiences. Because of this cognitive quirk, visualization prepares our minds for success and squelches our fears in the process. Application: If you’re worried about something you need to do, visualize doing it successfully. For example, suppose you’re concerned about a big presentation you’re expected to give at your workplace. Close your eyes and see yourself giving the presentation. Take yourself through each step, each part of your speech, and each slide. Visualize completing your presentation and responding confidently to the audience’s questions. See yourself in the ideal state you hope to experience.

The problem is, emotions like anxiety, anger, and fear can overwhelm us and paralyze us into inaction. A little goes a long way, and too much can quickly overload us. We shouldn’t suppress negative emotions. On the contrary, we should learn to manage them. The best way to do this is to question whether your feelings align with logic and reason. When they’re in sync, it’s much easier to take purposeful action and make good decisions when things go wrong.

One of your inner critic’s superpowers is catastrophic thinking. It assumes the worst will happen in every situation. This outlook is contrary to logic and reason, and counters our intention to press on when we confront adversity. For example, suppose you’re trying to stay away from sugary foods. One day, you give into temptation and eat a donut. Your inner critic will try to convince you that this single mistake will have disastrous consequences. It will tell you that you’ll never be able to stick to a healthy diet, and you’ll inevitably become morbidly obese and pitifully lazy. You’ll be the laughing stock of everyone around you.

And the solution isn’t about what you know. I couldn’t care less about what you know; I care about what you’re capable of doing and what you actually do on a regular basis.

The next time someone asks, “How are you?” why not respond with “I’m doing well, right now I’m spending a lot of time working on my networking skills so I can get more clients.” Or “I’m doing well, I’m exercising more consistently because I want to have more energy to chase these kids around!” When said casually, it comes across as a natural answer and more importantly, it’s the truth.
